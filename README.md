<p> 👋 Hi, I’m **Giuseppe Turitto** <br />
         I have been involved in the software industry since the Y2K. I have been a Developer, an Architect, and now am Engineer Manager since 2012.
         The thing I enjoy the most as an EM is being a Mentor and a Coach and seeing my Engineers grow to places they only imagined in their dreams. 
         I am becoming a good friend of chatGPT
</p>

- 👀 I’m interested in so many things, but mostly Back End development, Virtualization of Infrastructures, and CI/CD Pipelines
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 🦀Rust & Go .
