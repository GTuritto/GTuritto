<p> 👋 Hi, I’m <b>Giuseppe Turitto</b> <br /><br /></p>

I have been involved in the software industry since Y2K. I have been a Developer, an Architect, and now an Engineer Manager since 2012.
- The thing I enjoy the most as an EM is being a Mentor and a Coach and seeing my Engineers grow to places they only imagined in their dreams.
- I am becoming a good friend of chatGPT

- 👀 I’m interested in so many things, but mainly Back End development, Virtualization of Infrastructures, and CI/CD Pipelines
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my solopreneur adventure.
- 💞️ If you are looking for a collaborator with a Product mentality, let's talk.
